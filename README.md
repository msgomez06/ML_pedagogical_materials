# Pedagogical Jupyter Notebooks written for the Machine Learning Classes at UNIL

This repository holds a copy of the machine learning notebooks I developed working as a teaching assistant for the Machine Learning for Environmental Science courses at Universit√© de Lausanne.

You'll find the unsolved notebooks in the /Labs folder. The solved notebooks may appear at some point in the future, but currently live in my Google Drive folder :)
